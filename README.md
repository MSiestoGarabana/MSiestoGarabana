## ðŸ‘‹ HI THERE! ðŸ‘‹
IÂ´m **Miguel Siesto** and IÂ´m a frontend developer based in **Madrid**.

After finishing my college studies at the "Universidad Complutense de Madrid", I followed a good friendÂ´s advise to try & learn the needed skills to become a Front-End Web Developer. I :heart_eyes::heart_eyes:loved the process!!:heart_eyes::heart_eyes: And most of all, loved realizing itÂ´s actually possible to fully learn a new skill by myself.

I consider myself to be an organized and hardworking person, that loves to put on the extra effort in order to grow personally and proffesionally.
IÂ´m a big **JSX and React** fan , currently looking forward learning TypeScript.

### :star:My current skills:star:
- **React and Redux**(https://es.reactjs.org/)
- **JavaScript(ES6)** & **JSX**
- **SASS & BootStrap**
- **Gatsby** for statically generating sites.
